# Random Permutation Set Reasoning 

This repository provides an implementation of **Random Permutation Set Reasoning** as described in the paper [Deng, Jixiang, Yong Deng, and Jian-Bo Yang. "Random Permutation Set Reasoning." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2024).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39102326/). It focuses on the **Algorithm 1** from the paper. 


## Not Implemented
- Hyperparameter tuning in **Algorithms 2 and 3** is not included in this implementation. These sections involve tuning parameters for improving the performance and accuracy of the reasoning process but are left for future work or customization.
